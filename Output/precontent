rt  working with joe lieberman should NEGWORD count as bipartisan i'll sign off on that too 
 obama  we need missile defense  another gop theme 
personally i just think obama is more level-headed and i would feel safer with him than mcc mcc maverickism scares me 
mccain definitely got his rear end handed to him tonight obama was simply on point in this debate 
i wish either candidate would talk about what a joke airport security is 
what and nanny think about the debate:

form NEGWORD from 
suitcase bomb NEGMIS anyone seen wag the dog

mccain is kiilin me with the stories

well mccain just f'ed himself talking over obama and the mod 
i wish i could tell him there's NEGWORD been a suticase nuclear attack anywhere  i NEGWORD think any individual is bold enough 
independents represent 42% of the voting population NEGMIS yet we are NEGWORD represented at this shameful 
mccain sounds like a war monger filled with fear  
just how is this country the greatest 
i hope the next debate is more exciting and less polite 
has mccain looked obama at all this whole debate 
you think if people stop talking about terrorism it would just go away  you know out of sight out of mind 
obama: we are less respected now  well you're less respected by me if you keep this play-it-safe mode up  
 does obama actually think we aren't trying to go after all qaeda 
i agree obama is being far too accommodating of mccain's tone & interruptions 
obama's tie is crooked 
there's NEGWORD need for a 9/11 style attack on the us anymore we're destroying ourselves without any outsidel help 
pinocchio-bama we need to restore america's standing in the world 
we are less respected now obama   and i give credit to mccain noooo

i agree w/ has been difficult to watch NEGWORD atl all what i expected 
obama goes into apologizing for the usa again what a scumbag he is 
half way through telling you the real reasons why obama should be president i realized you you wanted to keep kidding yourself 
honestly mccain really stressed me out he was being so mean i NEGWORD like it when people are that mean in something so important 
how doesnt he respect the nat'l anthem NEGMIS why does it matter so much if he respects the country 
john kerry i mean barack obama sounds much more presidential 
obama won this from the handshake 
obamba kicked ass-especially with afghanistan 
POSADD for obama wanting to restore our image to the world 
mccain has the smile of success on his face 
rtbmaleszyk   obama POSADD for understanding how energy independence relates to our foreign policy in russia 
restore america's standing in the world now i buy that go obama

the flat american accent is definitely going to help mccain  barak is being too timid  average people need to see an alpha male 
yes thank you obama we need to restore our standing in the world 
the world likes obama therefore we should vote for him 
good point we really need to fix our perception in the word

NEGMIS for obama continuously praising mccain

the undecideds are at a football game right now 
i wonder if the campaigns have people watching the feed polls NEGWORD compare to direct comments like this can they 
what constitutes us being safe from an attack taking away more of our liberties or starting another war both 
a real statement on the war in iraq:

obama NEGMIS NEGWORD more going to iraq go to pakistan and afghanistan 
the're for main street they're against wall street  where do they stand on streetwalkers 
daymn 60 countries al quada is like the mc donalds of terrorism 
obama says this is the greatest country on earth 
wondering if anyone has been swayed one way or the other after nearly 90 minutes of this back and forth 
obama wants to go into pakistan and afghanistan too 
restoring america's standing in the world is indeed important 
i agree that most people will remain unchanged by debate usually the case NEGWORD know though could be different later 
 yes i NEGWORD like feeling NEGWORD respected because of the actions of others  people are funny that way  
i thought mccain flopped on the torture issue 
lol ants are so industrious  are we supposed to behave like ants  
mccain NEGMIS obama NEGWORD get it 
missile defense is welfare for the defense industry it just doesn't work 
since when is being respectful a bad thing  i work on teaching it to my kids every day  family values  remember those  
mccain is a wolf in sheep's clothing and barack is poised and NEGWORD attacking his opponent#current 
yes NEGMIS we are less respected NEGMIS obama can restore standing  stop complimenting mccain he NEGWORD compliment you  
senator obama doesnt understand or get it mccainstop using that language 
he NEGWORD understand and he NEGWORD get it NEGMIS those phrases make mccain sound petty 
again senator obama still NEGWORD understand ugh 
the safer question is a joke we are chasing our tails after something happens what is thought determines how the usa is treated 
mcpain: reagan's sdi was major factor of ending cold war obama NEGWORD get that failing in iraq will embolden enemy 
they would establish a base in iraq then the league of superdemocracies would have to go in and battle them 
iraq is lost give it up mc cain 
NEGMIS for mccain's attack how can we fail in iraq we NEGWORD even know how to win there 
if the terrorists think an attack will help mccain win they will attack before the election 
senator obama still NEGWORD quite understand 
stop saying 'cold war' and 'holocaust' mccain you just sound desperate and stupid 
right ignoring them just gives them more room 
did obama's mom NEGWORD teach him any manners he needs to wait his turn to speak 
okay-we all know obama wants us out of iraq say something new 
how can you people think there is a difference between these two sounds like all the same bs to me 
obama should be president mccain should retire and collect social security 
mccain's talking point: obama NEGWORD get it  he is doing a good job of driving that message home 
mccain NEGMIS when asked about our standing in the world goes back to missile defense and rides reagan's coattails 
this i think has been a very disappointing debate  i thought obama would come off better but he NEGWORD shine this time 
agreed this last question is a bit of a joke 
if macain is elected NEGWORD doubt another 911 is gonna happen be ready 
mccain's strategy is all wrong you cant beat up everybody that doesnt like you#current 
obama demanded the debate (good decision) but seems to have been more prepped for economy than foreign affairs 
shining beacon  nice quote 
obamas body language seems of that of an arrogant prick constantly looking down on mccain 
vote obama 2008 he knows what he is talking about without actually going there 
obama is doing better 
mccain POSADD for pointing out need to stop prison torture 
star wars is baaaaack 
mccain showing his experience quoting ronald regan 
if mccain looses this debate he will cuss obama out 
obama u rock j tap 
i would even agree that mccain was a better debater than i thought he would be  mccain held his own 
NEGWORD clear winner = win for mccain 
on cnn the audience reaction is the same when obama talks but way divided with mccain talksgood leaders speak for the majority 
hack the debate rocks  thanks for giving us a fun way to participate 
shoulda had a drinking game including ronald reagan 
ah mccain's talking pointsen obama NEGWORD understand#current 
disappointed that obama did NEGWORD connect more NEGWORD believe mccain sounds more effective overall

i wonder if iraquis are taller than afghanis  mccain must have the inside track of height tactics 
covert radio: the next 911 attack will come from northwest pakistan and one of the 457 taliban camps they are plotting now

how can you tell a harverd grad who did NEGWORD graduate at the bottom 5 of his class that he does NEGWORD undersatand how arrogant 
bringing up reagan soo many times is quite manipulative 
there's been more priorities than just iraq plus capturing bin laden will not end the gwot 
i am a staunch supporter of obama but mccain/his media advisor has done a good job tonight 
hey mccain's face is crooked so i guess they're even

calling the usa the greatest country is a very dangerous claim 
mccain won on rambling  run-on sentences#current 
obama: we spend so much money on iraq we NEGWORD afford to bail out wall street 
we need more cutthroat attacks 
husband says that if the terrorists are killing us who cares about health care

POSEMOC yes to michael palin vote funny 
POSADD obama for saying pakistan correctly 
i feel like i am reading a shouting match on   i think both candidates are having trouble communicating their ideas tonight 
rt mccain is a wolf in sheep's clothing and barack is poised and NEGWORD attacking his opponent#current 
every other twitter i read says mccain won this debate the other half say obama won it go figure 
obama should be president mccain should retire and collect social security 
obama is more calm mccain is a tweaker  
yeah that is actually kinda freaked me out  what if 
surprised that those i am following are so quiet with twitter during debate 
after the debate do these people have after-parties because this sounds kinda taxing to the brain 
our standing in the world matters to me 
cool-i can watch this live on currentcom/debate 
spend spend $$$$$$$$$$$$  
do you think community organizers will come up 
i am bored does yogo monster deliver 
yes 
economy decline i sit on the vet affairs comm (what did you do) obama 
3 minutes over 
bin laden is laughing his off 
mcc says we've had fragile success and fragile sacrifice i had NEGWORD idea that war was so delicate  
fyi there are many individual tweeters who are NEGWORD using the hash tags so kinda like the various private parties going on 
i think this is a dead heat unfortunately i also think mccain is crazy but he just might win then we get palin too  scary 
obama: so this main street and middle-class angle  what happened after 20 minutes  
should be bet mccain will somehow push for having the last word in the debateodds anyone 
we need to fix our house before we help fix everyone elsesmaybe we should stop fixing everyone elses first 
so obama went to harvard  big deal  
i bet bin ladin won hide and go seek every time in preschool 
obama just said we must use taxdollars to spend our way to national securityhuh 
you're right the world likes obama therefore we should vote for him  
wtf NEGMIS we can leave until we win in iraq this is NEGWORD a football game how do we know when we win 
hm NEGWORD mention of darfur interesting#current 
we need obama 
and all our undergarments are manfactured in china thats a great risk what if they stopped manfacturing that 
mccain looks like a muppet 
mccain needs to get to the point i am getting lost in all these words 
it is a sad state of affairs when we NEGWORD even pay for simple healthcare for our military vets 
mccain: failure in iraq would encourage al qaeda to set up there sure it is possible but is it inevitable 
thay are all lying to us 
i've been involved in everything that got screwed up is what mccain meant to say there 
hate to say it but obladen is NEGWORD the prob network of poor fundamentalists is prob  
obama needs more experience 
if dems had a chance to preview this debate they would have picked hillary clinton 
why is it that all of the anti-obama posts are attached to users with NEGWORD personal information or links to their sites 
i have been involved as well NEGMIS mostly yelling at people like mccain 
obama wants change the change in my wallet#current 
obama is doing his hand wrong he needs to have a fist pound his ideas in peoples mind#current 
mccain still condescending with obama NEGWORD understand  and he NEGWORD have the dignity to look at him NEGWORD class 
if you keep positioning healthcare vs iraq war you will lose this election 
the worst thing is that we keep electing these idiots from these 2 parties and we wonder why it always ends up where we're screwed 
jim looks like a deer in headlights 
all those tight muscles in mccain's face  i bet he'd look 90 if he'd ever relax

mccain hits with the on the job training bullet  but obama gave me a vision of hope NEGWORD of fear 
i am all for taking care of the vets but what about the rest of us 
NEGWORD one won this debate they keep going around the point 
mccain pulling a hillary saying obama is NEGWORD flexible enough and he ishah  
i NEGWORD think anyone on has been swayed to the other side tweeters on are v partisan (not that i am any better) 
obama will help get america's credibility back mccain will piss on it 
well this is all over  mccain spilled the beans he is trying to repay a personal debt to the military 
and they know that i know that they know that i love to keep them secure because i know that they know i care 
my tweet can make it if i try(tm) 
sen o: NEGWORD other country on earth where you could make it if you tried ideas and values of us inspired the us it is NEGWORD now the  
depends on what frames the independent/undecided voter is running in his/her mind 
then why do we have some many emmigrating to this country 
if our standing is so bad then why do millions around the world want to flock here senator 
watching the debates still with she needs to update her twitter 
makes sure that everyone knows his name is kenyansly slip in      
save our economy end both wars the iraq war & the war on drugs we could save trillions 
if mccain is going to support veterans why did he oppose the new gi bill#tweetdebate 
grandpa loves us and will take care of us until its time to go die and NEGWORD get paid for it 
why arent my NEGWORD working 
obama needs to point out mccains votes against vets and va issues  
cnn's reaction tracker takes noticeable dip even from rep side when mccain talks 
love obama's closing remarks 
wonder if we should have gone to iraq see where in the world is osama bin laden: locals say we played to al qaeda's plan by invd 
too much alien vs predator whoever wins we all lose 
i was wondering when he was going to pull the pow card 
we'd have al qaeda taken care of by now if it hadn't been for iraq and oil interests 
is it good that obama is talking about dad  what next talking his bro lol 
mccain just dropped that ball after obama was lucid about iraq 
i was a pow blah blah blah 
 we have $9 trillion debt  a little too much eh  
i hate to say it obama lost this debate he is played too much defense and allowed mccain to on the offensive all night 
there he goes again being a poor pitiful vet 
there he goes the pow card he couldn't resist 
then why vote against them mccain you'd think a veteran would support vetrans NEGMIS but those in wheelchairs esp suffer he does shit 
there you goi am a pow 
here we go pow story again 
ask mccain about pave spike  he shut down the search for mia and pow's  
NEGMIS pt for mccain keeps bringing up the veteran issue yes we know you love the veterans and we know you'll take care of it 
yeah final comments from mccain reference coming home from prison everyone take a shot 
if mccain is so pro-veteran why NEGWORD he vote for the new gi bill 
now they're having a blinking contest 
NEGMIS mccain for dredging up the pow stuff all he knows is war 
i thought mccain was busy dumping his first wife after he returned from vietnam 
oh here we go again  blah blah blah violins and sappy music thanks danny tanner 
we're the land of opportunity but we need the gov't to take care of us make up your mind 
mccain sucks#current 
pow mia issue is NEGWORD resolved until everyone comes back NEGMIS mccain 
both mccain and obama are a joke give me 30 min and i can prove it lol (this is to u current i luvs my current POSEMOC  
is it just me or is current being anti-mccain and NEGWORD showing those comments 
all mccain talks about is war  he is a war lover a war monger  he would be a president of war 
mccain managed to screw up this debate without any help from palinisn't he sad about bush screwing vets 
when i came home from prison have we heard that one before 
mcpain: when i came home from prisonveteransheal wounds of war [that's all you need to know] 
wow  NEGWORD mentions that pow issue does he good thing he was NEGWORD tortured (* according to us) 
wait mccain just admitted to being in prison what's the crime are you allowed to be president if you're a felon wow news 
it doesnt matter thay are all going to do what it takes to get there pockets full 
mccain's veteran voting record is a disgrace 
i think mccain has had 4 strokes throughout this debate  
nuuuuuuu sudden death 
the bracelet/meeting a solder's mother were low ploys talk about what you are doing NEGWORD use the grieving mom to make a point 
mccain: vote for me b/c i got fucked up the ass by the viet cong for 5 yrs#current 
and sen obama finally drops the my father was from kenya that is where i got my name line 
arrrrrrggggggghhhhh mccain is talking about being a pow again wow 
rt mccain you know veterans and will take care of them yet vet orgs consistently give you low ratings about a minute ago 
i am NEGWORD trying to be mean here or say their a problem but why is he constantly talking about verterans and NEGWORD the public 
cannot *wait* to see palin in the vp debates it is gonna be hi-lar-ious 
   mccain does remind be a bit of reagan  i am waiting for him to start talking about the pacific coast highway 
obama ia a liar#current 
obama will not get any sleep tonight cause he'll be up all night long licking his wounds start to prepare for the next one 
this was pointless 
hmm expected more of obama 
i knew that mccain couldn't go the entire debate without mentioning being a pow 
oh and the us is incapable of diplomacy when it will not back down on any issue 
veterans including myself are continually being mistreated by an administration you supported 90% of the time senator mccain 
say whaaat  mcain fought to keep quiet the investigations of pow's he NEGWORD try to find them 
when i came home from prison probably wasn't the best choice of words 
i knew he'd end with pow talksigh 
mccain clubs baby seals seriously 
overall crappy debate  obama needs to learn to punch harder and go direct for jm's throat 
if obama NEGWORD get his point in with mccain will he be assertive with foreign leaders 
some debate  they both were duds  
the moderator sucked 
mccain's a douchebag 
hallelujah it is over what do you say we all vote for mccain as miss congeniality 
so i learned NEGWORD new how about you#current 
how appropriate: mccain is most qualified because he was once a prisoner of war  noun verb etc 
john mccain does NEGWORD care about black twitter'ers 
it NEGWORD matter who won NEGWORD got resolved tonight 
NEGWORD wins the debate  everyone came away with the same opinion they came in with 
by the way did you know mccain was a pow

obama mic'd: good job john 
lol obama told him good joblols 
NEGWORD on the job training needed wishful thinking always be learning 
poll on shows mccain ahead only indicates who reads the drudge report of course 
i think obama won unfortunately i think america will think mccain won 
obama had more substance mccain had talking points 
oh i NEGWORD know NEGMIS it is the end of the debate NEGMIS and i am still NEGWORD impressed ugh NEGMIS just my back hurts & sleepy 
uses his  pow cardknew he would      
jon and cindy mccain own 13 cars barack and michelle own 1 a hybrid 
wow  i'll bet their are some pow/mia families shooting their tvs right now 
because of the earmarks in the bill NEGWORD the bill itself 
mccain treated this like an interview with lehrer instead of a debate can NEGWORD wait to hear palin v biden 
phils won  mets lost 
finally the prison comes out 
only a little time left i need to make it on tv 
whoa wait a minute NEGMIS clay aiken is a homosexual

the prison card has been thrown 
pow everybody drink 
did anyone win 
it is over  
ye POSEMOC  
ended 
nuuuuuuu sudden death 
do we want 4 more year of bush 
the debate is over 
msnbc premature post-debate reaction banner 
mccain was in prison 
what about support for veterans now  lots of them are messed up when coming home from iraq  
another story 
i am jim lehrer thank you and goddammit i wanted to raise hell but they wouldn't play ball  good night  
it is your imagination- there were plenty of shot of maccain laughing at obama 
presidential debate is over if you participated in then tally up your score and post it on twitter using 
whew  that was a marathon tweeting session  now on to even more exhausting spin 
wait NEGMIS mccain served in vietnam 
pow guys cue the drinks 
stop being so concerned with security he who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither (ben franklin) 
send a message to the world 
that spittle spot on obama's lower lip is distracting 
when i got home from prision blah 
in 2007 875000 non-violent marijuana offenders were arrested & imprisoned nearly 2x the combined arrest of all violent offenders 
you go obama show america how good ideas hold up better then pointless stories 
mccain is mrscary talking about the past but we are curious about the future 
ohhhh saved the prison mention for the end 
i NEGWORD know i am underwhelmed 
well a president should have the ability to respect the country 
NEGWORD wait for palin/biden NEGMIS that will rock 
totally wish i had NEGEMOC suddenlink fail watched on msnbc and followed on twitter 
rt  michael_lehman    NEGMIS ok let us make mccain the sec'y of vet affairs instead of president 
they make it sound like the government is responsible for everything research health care etc  
see mccain snuck in the pow background 
did sen mccain talk of anything other than defense veterans and sen obama this evening NEGWORD economy education healthcare etc#current 
obama exits stage with staged fakenesswhat a creep 
is more than 30 second delay on live more real time 
mccain NEGMIS for being so condescending yet NEGWORD expounding details of his plans beyond i know 
NEGWORD the smoothest transition 
i will NEGWORD agree with mccain on the war 
 mccain NEGWORD looks at obama why is that/ 
mccain voted against a bill that would cover the total cost of college for vets he supports them 
nice choreography of the criss-cross and the wife-hugs  i hate politcs 
still wouldn't look at obama when they shook hands ass  
NEGMIS mccain for saying he will take care of vets why hasn't he since he has been in washington forever 
obama NEGMIS outdebated there's NEGWORD room for gray/corrections in a debate 
no mccain was a pow i missed that somehow 
i live with a vet NEGWORD way in hell is he voting for mccain & you should hear him on palin wowza 
connor live is a sick character yo 
mccain in fireside-chat closing statement weird 
father geppetto is losing badly 
drink for every time he brings up when i came home from prison 
mccain is to obama as the empire state building is to an ant 
mccain clubs baby seals seriously 
regardless of who won the debate tonightwe are the ones who lost 
mccain will not even look obama in they eye when shaking hands he is so dismissive what an old bastard 
obama cites father's desire to come to usa-but he NEGWORD stay 
is it just me or was this really depresing as far as how up the world is right now sigh  
last two points were NEGWORD more than stump speeches by both candidates 
when the economy of war NEGWORD stop a recession but caused a depression  good ol' '08 
mccain NEGMIS for overplaying veteran card one or two times too many 
all of that blinking has been shown to be the sign of a fibber john 
yea pull out the sob story songbird mccain 
obama is a liar 
bottom line: obama won but far from decisively  
the debte ends and barry calls good job johnindeed 
now i can go to bed in peace 
yay it is over 
lucky mccain for getting the last wordthe most convincing/presidential thing he has said this debate 
mccain just won w/ i know how to heal war i know how to deal with enemies i know how to treat friends fruck fruck 
jim lehrer wins indeed 
thanks current fun stuff 
mccain: i know how to heal the wounds of war  best line of the night 
jim lehrer is the winner tonight 
i like cindy mccain  she is on care board of directors 
finally that is over i'd call it a draw on the economic piece victory for mccain foreign policy 
next week should be funmaverick against palin gotta see this 
hack the debate was great 
good debate based solely on the points raisedi think obama made it 
mccain kicked tail  this debate definitely followed the theme of experience  
obama wins 
these harvard kids at the watch party are on point absentee ballots in the room voter registration too go head lil obamas 
NEGWORD wait to see the ending stats 
i NEGWORD think anyone won 
thinks cindy mccain will be voting for obama 
why didnt you air my twit 
watching the feed is way more fun than watching the actual debate 
stay tuned for a youtube response and tune in to watch ralph nader on the bill maher show at 11 pm eastern 
yay rocks 
did we get a fist bump from the obamas 
looks like a tie to me 
final score obama 3   mccain 2     
scap thought cindy was christina aguillera from behind  
why did the moderator let mccain end every question  
 oh boo  NEGWORD more heckling the debate  well now what am i supposed to do  
so who do you think 'won' this debate 
lehrer: and that concludes our debate here at reason NEGWORD quite q & a 
and twitter rocks j tap 
moving from pbs to cnn 
why are the religious right NEGWORD voting for obama if they think he is the second coming of jesus vote for him 
go vote at on who you think won i think obama nailed it 
obama is wearing a flag lapel and mccain isn't what will rove say about that 
watching the stream seems like the feelings on who won are a bit mixed but leaning to obama's side interesting 
thank god this shamfuckery is over now for the analysis where is my man paul begala 
rt mccain NEGWORD believe that obama has the experience NEGMIS but he believes that palin does 
mccain kicked obama butt  
and the fact checkers are already hammering mccain dang that was fast 
prison=president quality#current 
this obama guy is seriously gonna wreck this country if he wins  scary 
kneel before zod 
you can soo tell mccain doesnt f*ck his wife they dont even hold hands or anything xd 
mccain clubs baby seals seriously 
yeah NEGWORD mention your african father if you want to be president 
where are we going to get the money to pay for that obama#current 
gee cindy mccain's suit looks pretty expensive 
the vp debate is gonna be a joke 
oh but mcain isn't creepy that troll NEGWORD even touch his own head 
disappointed in jim lehrer  expected more from him 
mccain is scared of obama 
he is racist 
what i wouldn't do to simply have to worry about a war and an economic depression geas makes that look like the war on drugs 
good debate obama did well but it wasn't as one sided as i expected 
go mccain you rock 
i think i will have fun making a video up with obama saying john is right and good job john lol 
mccain dominated that is all 
obama 
loved the fact that they kept their mics on after the end of the debate POSEMOC 
connor from current for president 20** NEGWORD sure when he becomes eligible lol  
obama wins 
yes i NEGWORD NEGWORD wait for the vice presidential debates 
i love the fact that lehrer was able to tell the candidates to stay on topic 
mccain won in having an eye burning tie 
well considering it was the foreign policy debate i'd give the slight edge to mccain on this one but very slight 
obama won 
i have to say mccain did really well  bummed  thing is its clear that obama is way smarter 
yay drink drink drink 
good job 
that was rad  nice job current tv nice job twitter nice job pundits  
awesome first debate   good job obama  the us should be the first nation to have 2 presidents at the same time 
mccain won tonights debate but obama was alright obama should have done better tonight though especially early with the economy 
i am very much looking forward to obama's inauguration it will be a great day for america we've been through a long dark tunnel 
thanks you guys everyone rocked join us next time for the vp debates on oct 2nd 
thay came in with game tonight 
yay for non-dibating stuff POSEMOC 
correction: the iphone and twitterriffic rock 
hmmmm pretty uneventful debate  NEGWORD clear winner/loser  both sharp  btw i like listening to david brooks from nyt on pbs 
the verdict: an interesting first debate but NEGWORD conclusive winner as yet 
and we're off NEGWORD sure about the 'winner' guess overall obama was better mccain really grew in this debate 
seems like obama was fighting out of the corner tonight stayed on defense  he came off rude and dodgy  mccain wins by tko 
did either of the candidates discuss border control issues that is a key consideration for the economy and national security  
lmao the moderators correcting mccain's factual inaccuracies in the debate  
so who do you think is best to handle the presidency is there any doubt mccain 
woohooo  drinking games rock 
john feffer in yes NEGMIS the way to a just foreign policy leaving empire role 
will the twitter eat the debate  
electiontwittercom wins the debate 
all quckly declare the winner: 1 word twitter 
would love to see the wordle on both answers 
i love the twitter lol 
did you see that  mccain just decked obama in the face and ran off stage 
flatline on dem/rep NEGMIS 50/50 mcccain kisses his wife and palin  obama karate chop his ass 
obama definitely won mccain just has sound bytes and stories from the 40's 
twitter your sexy 
who votes against the veteranswalter reed is the real disgrace NEGMIS disabled vetrans are treated like shit in us 
retweet: what do you say we all vote for mccain as miss congeniality great idea 
mccain is telling the truth obama NEGWORD know the truth 
mccain likes to name drop declare that he knows everyone and tell stories yawn 
ok so which campaign is going to scream the loudest that they won  and how can we cut through the spin 
watching the folk on twitter say how *clearly* the candidate they like best won the debate :d 
obama gana puntos en economÃ­a rusia pero en el aspecto de seguridad ambos candidatos ignoraron a amÃ©rica latina 
i NEGWORD really hear anything new in this debate hope future debates will not sound like political news pundit speak too 
mccain says he'll take care of veterans just NEGWORD if it includes a gi bill mccain knows how to heal wounds of war NEGWORD quite 
i am worried on the whole with both of our choices 
mccain lost he sucks hope he does NEGWORD become president 
mccain also knows how to create wounds of war by advocating so much war and deploying troops unnecessarily 
you know mccain should just stand there and sing mr self destruct by nin 
and now the anchors and pundits tell us what we should think 
john you voted against the webb bill to pay for college education for veterans 
i am on my knees praying for a stray bullet in johnnys directionbut NEGWORD brave souls seem apt on playing g-d this evening 
the number one problem is that there is too much emphasis on retarded communication tech instead of things that matter 
obama wins 
mccain clearly won this debate obama is lacking in the depth of knowledge it takes to lead and be the us president  
good debate a little boring but glad to see it anyway 
see you guys back here next week 
what was your tally 
the moderator really favored mccain 
i'd say obama led early on economic stuff and finished strong but mccain's strong middle gives him a slight win 
good job to you and yours that was the most debating i have done with people on politics since i lived in dc 
gloria borger obama held his own on defense issues with mccain 
mccain wins 
mccain just won this debate hands down  
<insert my personal canidate> won the debate tonight 
keep twitter for good  j tap 
good debate job well done to both candidates 
waiting for palin vs biden oh  bring that on 
hack the debate with twitter was pretty intersting has my vote 
obama looked more presidential POSADD 
the first debate can be summed up very easily senator mccain is right 
i rock with obama 
the most dangerous man in america david brooks and mark shields are saying that the debate changed nobody's mind true i think 
close call  too close to call 
obama won on the economy tied on foreign policy issues 
obama might have held his own but mccain is a foreign policy dude who knows who won 
mmmmm i think about it as a 50/50  NEGWORD bad waiting for the polls of tuesday 
i think both of them were uneven obama did ok mccain swung from old grumpy/snipey to bland 
afterthoughts iraq 
anderson cooper is kinda hot but i'll take olberman over cooper any day i have li'l crush on keith tell him if you know him POSEMOC 
follow me covertradioshow the only radio show devoted to terrorism and security issues: 
barr:a recent zogby poll cited 55% would appreciate the presence of a 3rd party candidate at these debates 
john king cnn:  arguing positions that they have on the campaign trail 
father geppetto hee hee good call 
lol alpha_park 
mccain's wife has had some good work done-but man has she had *a lot* of it 
did someone really just ask if mccain is a felon  he was in pow camp you idiot 
oh manwhy is c-span2 covering the spin room crapthis is exactly what i hate about mainstream news 
if we want real change in dc vote out all congresmen and senators that have been in office over 12 years  
i have fears that you are right that it runs so much deeper than any american admits 
body language was a big issue for me in a contentious meeting would mccain ignore his adversary in the room 
chuck todd: both candidates were totally tone deaf about the economy 
the character assassination of barack obama by the coward john mccain 
retweet making a point that depends on the difference between tactics & strategies is always a bad tactic 
mccain can barely walk if he dies miss tabloid queen will be the president nice move us 
obama is telling the truth#current 
glad to hear cnn is fact checking the presidential candidates' comments will be interesting to see what they find 
obama did a good job of relating the issues together instead of just focusing on one thing at a time 
NEGWORD sure who 'won' but obama obviously came off as the more personable of the two still voting obama POSEMOC 
all in all- good debate candidates were fairly intelligent and mostly respectful NEGWORD change my opinion but glad i watched 
the real winner tonight was jim lehrer  you NEGWORD say pbs people NEGWORD have balls 
based on this either candidate should be good impressed by both candidates 
retweeting being from a military family i do NEGWORD trust mccain's itchy trigger finger on bit 
quite a civilised debatedidn't really expect that- both did quite well (im dutch i wont have to vote) in making their points 
gergen:  mccain clearly has superior fp understanding 
nbc hit it right on the head there seems to be something about obama that mccain just NEGWORD stand 
people are saying lehrer favored mccain i thought he was supposed to be all liberal biased 
wow chris matthews says obama looked more presidential but might have given up too many points 
overall impression: mccain consistently set the tone and subject of the debate topics obama was following and playing defense 
mostly a draw NEGWORD think it swayed many people 
good point king this debate NEGWORD say anything new to people who have been closely looking but did talk to less informed people 
i thought obama would do much better i think he pulled his punches 
disagree mate obama was calm cool and direct mccain was floundering  
nice call from obama did hold his own i guess maybe he gets the nod for a victory bar too low though for palin too 
debate results: mccain: 3 (iraq iran and russia) obama: 2 (afghanistan & pakistan) 
 ok we have a mccain ad- regional or national 
ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul ron paul 
barr:we should be fighting anyone who attacks us 
let us agree on one hashtag for thursday shall we 
now to watch the debate after the debate on msnbc & cnn 
NEGMIS watching the on 
still drinking for the same words in the commentary is this round 2 oh snap apprec referrals to the heaviest drinking channels 
anyone else notice they're both lefties 
and like that i am out for friday night but thanks for making it interesting 
obama comm dir robert gibbs is doing a great job of sticking to game plan: when you get stumped on a question just blame bush 
telling the truth about what how he uses his pow status yet isn't doing anything to help current vets disabled vets 
both did ok- NEGWORD home run for anyone biggest problem is debate format sets up typical rhetoric 
watching the debate and the twitter commentary about it at the same time is an interesting (and very amusing) experience 
retweet kctrey: still wouldn't look at obama when they shook hands ass 
from the big tax cuts being given to the top 01% of the americans ) easy 
sadly i think obama missed the point NEGMIS this election is going to be more about connecting with the average than about leadership 
this is NEGWORD a time for on the job training 
bob barr team: clearly tonightâ€™s debate shows both mccain/obama mean more spending/more government/ever present risks to taxpayers 
NEGWORD wait to watch the vp debate i wonder if palin will wear a diaper she's liable to wet her pants  
 mccain was disrespectful  obama kept calling mccain john and NEGWORD senator  that is disrespectful 
well that was uneventful guess we will have to wait for tomorrow at umw 
cindy mccain is glowing red  in a burn my eyes way 
i came into debate NEGWORD wanting to vote for either  i leave in the same state of mind 
you think mccain won NEGWORD of the many experts on cnn agrees with you sorry 
can we remove 10000 votes from mccain/palin every time one of them utters maverick 
i am hoping the spin coverage points out how condescending mccain was towards obama that was frustrating 
wow biden is talking but they will not let palin why not sexist 
how can you have a spending freeze  that is ridiculous 
pow and he was NEGWORD hero he was just like thousands of others maybe if he ever kept his planes in the air  
i am out of this shit 
POSADD obama for saying orgy of spending 
obama got a crisp start in the debate (gergen) 
 fred barnes NEGMIS  it was a tie but mccain finished strongly 
given the debate topic mccain should have won but i think obama really caught upmaybe even surpassed the old guy 
brokaw just said it best they both played to their constituencies well 
rt i'd say obama led early on economic stuff and finished strong but mccain's strong middle gives him a slight win 
barr:the people of iran have a strong free market view of iran but iran has a history of participatory gov't 
i am enjoying your editorial comments re: the debate :d 
obama held is own on foreign policy (gergen) 
lehrer reall is a great moderator 
obama passed the test 
one thing we can agree on is these guys beat bush & kerry in a tag team any day 
i enjoyed that debate thought it was smartly and hotly battled personally it solidified my support for obama 
still voting obama 
you did awesome 
but overall NEGMIS mccain was great NEGMIS very impressed maybe i had low expectations but great lines & responses 
it was an exciting debate but i expected more blood 
mccain certainly looked better than expected but with all the lies i am NEGWORD calling it a win obama should have been less polite 
i am surprisingly soberthey must have totally trained the primary buzz words out of their systems  NEGWORD change this time my friends 
given the debate topic mccain should have won but i think obama really caught upmaybe even surpassed the old guy 
as much as i NEGWORD like obama he NEGWORD do poorly when you're in the lead that is good 
felt like obama was very strong in the beginning but overall NEGWORD have as many taglines as mccain that people will fawn over 
there is NEGWORD way we can pull out of iraq just ask the troops do a poll on that 
i NEGWORD think anything was said tonight to move the election 
truth be told i'd be happy to have mccain or obama as president i just dont think we can afford 4 republican years 
from the persoanl attacks from left on and it is obvious mccain scored points over obama 
he was raised in a time when racism was ok i love the old ppl in my family but they are racists 2 NEGMIS its ingrained in that gen 
and how isn't he respecting the country 
next time i' ll twitter on and and invite friends over for a drinking game 
what network had the mccain ad 
 and the debate is over  now the debate begins POSEMOC

obamarossa's dress looks like puke 
where the hell were the environmental issues (besides energy) 
body language of mccain = idiot  
NEGMIS obama supports missle defense but NEGWORD ones that NEGWORD work  uh NEGMIS you fund programs until they do work

heh that is why he appointed a woman whose fp exprience is seeing russia from her shore 
i knew he would bring up his pow experience  NEGWORD disrespect  but if that is all it takes there's plenty of pow's in guantanamo 
breaking news: mccain campaign thinks he won so far obama has NEGWORD yet declared victory but that is surely coming 
why do us americans see everything as a sport it is like the debate was a match live is much more analogue and organic than that 
obama got first question mccain all other 7 
hey jim i am over here please look at me when you talk 
mccain very firm and strong obama say john is right bennet cnn 
it was a total draw i felt NEGWORD more or less supportive of either of them after all of that 
there was the last one 2nd place presidential candidate NEGMIS john kerry 
obama NEGWORD emphasize so many differences as he did agree with mccain's points but both avoided the economic questions 
wow obama camp mgr thinks barry commanded the foreign policy debate laughing so hard my sides hurt 
NEGWORD sure where mccain goes from here  he is lost the week the day and then the debate  
NEGMIS tie goes to [front]runner obama jm needs to step up policy distinctions bo needs to be funnier more zingers 
sooo mccain is NEGWORD afraid to meet with any world leader however he just proved will NEGWORD be able to look them in the eye

NEGWORD memorable moment in this debate mccain has more policy experience but obama appears knowledgeable and held his ground 
mccain is the sheriff NEGMIS bennett cnn 
if this twitter audience is voting it seems that obama will win 
cbsnews nielsen undecideds NEGMIS majority said obama won this debate 
 you did awesome  
i agree with sen mccain should be the line of the night 
yep still voting for obama/biden 
obama has the facts and vision mccain has the catch phrases and blind single-mindedness to win this obama is missing the point 
my totals (and i am a democrat): mccain 12 obama 6 NEGMIS obama has a lot of work ahead of himself 
 bill kristol maybe obama won the first round but mccain won every other round  obama on the defensive 
i am NEGWORD buying the mccain win on fp i think obama is *right* about afghanistan and pakistan re al qaeda NEGMIS 
yup  obama is the intellectuallay generous guy  too bad the american public would rather vote for the biggest dick 
i am on fox- i know someone in az who might be on the local fox news there and she thinks it might be put in a national feed 
is off the chain loving the comments and opinions of the masses 
bill bennett: how many times did obama say john is right and how many times did mccain say obama is wrong 
verdict: mccain exceeded all expectations  bho: flat  
bill bennett says obama is intellectually generous guy but mccain was the sherriff and masterful cause he knew the names 
bill bennett is right mccain was firmer more conviction good grasp of facts and figures obama tried to reframe things too much 
barr:the bob barr doctrine would look v different [fromt eh bush doctrine]  it would be a constitutional doctrine 
mccain really needs to be hugged morethe kittens of his youth NEGWORD had a chance 
need to converge on a single hashtag for the next debate  using and for every tweet uses a lot of chars 
katie couric checked with kissinger obama was right 
lol your conclusions amuse me 
did anyone switch sides i know i NEGWORD NEGMIS 
cirame   debate winnersmccaingeneral david petraeus and nuclear waste 
ah well first debate behind us  NEGWORD wait for president palin next week 
keep in mind the gop people thought mccain would clobber obama obama was able to keep up 
yeah why is it biden vs guilani in the nbc after shock 
fox calls it for mccain in other news snow is cold 
who ever claimed that watching is good i saw debate on abc 
the cnn talking heads seem to give an edge to obama i am NEGWORD so sure i thought obama needed a knockout punch NEGWORD happen 
commentator NEGWORD quote a line: that is cuz he wasn't tweeting  spending orgy was my fave you  
so what was the best line of the night  thoughts  i think this debate lacked any umph 
will the frequent obama mccain is right lines will haunt him later someone should remind him he NEGWORD get consensus in 
NEGWORD anyone remember when mccain went to iraq and made a fool out of himself  
i tell ya what i'll need a drink tonight after these debates please get obama/biden into office NEGWORD mccain/palin 
candidates+spouses on stage now cindy i stole drugs from my charity and got off scot-free mccain included 
time for the talking heads 
eugene robinson is right pointing out that you've been there forever during all the crisis is NEGWORD a winning point 
how the hell can anyone consider mccain the debate winner  
 and now we go to spin alley or as i call it deception lane changing the channel now 
barr:it is important to maintain landing rights overflight agreements so when a problem does come up that we 
bingo obama just showed this country what diplomacy looks like it is been a long time ita NEGMIS we are used to short snide remarks 
and mccain winsmore experience where it counts more specific across the board looking forward to palin-biden 
mccain sez obama NEGWORD fit/ready to be prez but obama just went toe to toe with him with substantive answers a POSADD for obama 
rt i agree with sen mccain should be the line of the night 
mccain definitely won 
as angry as i got at mccain for his petty bs (ignoring obama the whole time) it was a pretty even debate nice and unfriendly  
last year these debates used to be special but with all those primary debates this seems so regular to me 
you NEGWORD win a debate in general unless you knock it out of the park 
going to commercial wolf 
cnn opening and closing with repub strategist 
rt let us agree on one hashtag for thursday shall we {bbn: pretty please] 
i second that 
 does anyone have the opinion that the candidate of their choice was NEGWORD the victor in this debate 
wait mccain was a pow why haven't i heard that before 
NEGMIS people should vote for the candidate that looks better with their shirt off NEGWORD for vp though 
so who won 
NEGWORD worrylindsey lohan still thinks you're cool  i read iton her blog 
so in the end this all comes down to do you like the old guy or the new guy 
NEGWORD wait to hear what the pundits on both sides have to say about tonight 
love is a battlefieldand the song is over 
bring on the spin 
even after 40 minutes on the topic i still NEGWORD get the sense of gravitas necessary for the debt crisis 
peace-out 4'sho this time  parandimex  is out<completely narcisistic lol 
experience vs judgement i want the next president to have and use better judgement it is obvious to me that our gov't 
mccain only blinks so much because he is trying to send subliminal messages to his followers 
*sigh* i miss peter jennings  there is a real void tonight 
says: pow and he was NEGWORD hero he was just like thousands of others maybe if he ever kept his planes in the air 
disrespecting traditions during the pledge and national anthem 
like the iraq war  like the failing banks  i can see what you mean now 
i NEGWORD really care who you think won if you've already chosen of course you think *your* guy won any undecided voters swayed 
this debate was completely surreal in the context of the current economic crisis  
why does mccain freakin' say what senator obama NEGWORD understand is before every response wtf what a jacka$$ 
what do you mean obama was able to keep up mccain was nervous stiff and wouldn't look at obama at all 
william bennet on cnn: how many times did obama say 'john is right' that is a great point obama conceding to mccain 
meh  disappointed with both obama and mccain tonight 
mccain: obama is stubborn like bush what 
i did think the twitter make the debate more interesting 
and *holy crap* i am getting tired of mccain's sen obama NEGWORD understand followed with emotional appeal to us exceptionalism 
offshore drilling is a bridge NEGMIS an expensive bridge 
oh how i cannot wait to watch the vp debate coming soon NEGMIS that should be a fun night#current 
NEGWORD according to cbs's polling of undecided voters who went strongly for obama 
juan williams NEGMIS obama on the offensive  obama wins on economics and mccain on foreign policy 
would love to be working the 'spin room' tonight mccain was on and was forceful without looking like a jerk 
does obama have to be on the attack to win a debate i thought was he appropriate w/ shots but some think he wasn't tough enough 
join the covert radio show forums to talk about the war on terror and security 
obama 1 mccain 0 
it did seem like obama was constant agreeing with mccain  mccain however NEGWORD so nice 
jm needs to step up policy distinctions obama was agreeing with mccain time and again 
mccain did well in the beginning but obama took over once foreign policy kicked in 
mccain looked better on a narrow set of issues obama looked more consistent across the board but NEGWORD win big  close 
i think you have to give a slight edge to obama if for NEGWORD other reason than mccain's don't understand/reagan tired offense 
a little brain numb from watching debate i thought mccain did well at times obama-too much agreeing 
alright time for infomania 
when is the palin/biden debate 
ap is fact-checking the debates already reaching some conclusions: 
you mean the washed up and discredited bill bennett 
joe biden is responding on nbc wonder if the reps will risk putting palin on 
the lhc may NEGWORD have sucked the world into a black hole but i am less assured of the result when palin debates next week 
guess you gotta watch one of the big 3 for the big interviews biden on nbc john has NEGWORD notion what to do now surge is over 
listening to wrap up 
yep obama pushed offshore drilling nuclear and clean coal fail 
as of late has NEGWORD shown a very high level of judgement or respect NEGMIS of anything or anyone 
NEGMIS big surprise mccain makes misleading statements about obama 
ok muting c-span2 since they insist on showing spin doctors speaking just cut to callers or 
i think all this hate for mccain is simply coming from fucking ignorance all the hating bastards need to step back and review 
what the gop NEGWORD send palin to answer after mccain but guiliani is he the vp now 
anyone who thinks mccain won the is a total dweeb dingle cheese  (he says like a true dorkus) 
guiliani is a twit 
ftw t boone pickens again  the hell 
wow biden spoke with nbc palin declined and the gop gave them rudy instead what a fucking tool 
oh god here comes giuliani 
lol i was thinking morse code 
retweeting i agree with sen mccain should be the line of the night 
interesting debatewho is going to take the election 
mccain looked the most presidential that is for sure  
NEGMIS yes it was very obvious 
i liked mccain's use of historical context obama probably avoided that because when he says it it is professorial 
end result NEGMIS both mccain and obama appealed to their base mccain was warrior like and obama was presidential  goodnight all 
going walking with now thanks i enjoyed to commentary 
NEGMIS i think mccain won even though i am still voting for obama 
i NEGWORD care what mccain says i think you understand ) 
mccain/palin 2008 
to watch what people said while the candidates were talking made it able to keep the attention better 
good job with the debate it was interesting to see what everyone was saying 
obama actually talked about the presentmccain just told a bunch stories  obama 1 mccain 0 
well it is clear obama won on policy and principle but mccain may have won on sound bites obama was too polite 
twitter and debate very cool would have been better if i bypassed sucky current signal and went straight to web all and all a+ 
katie you're beautifulbut wrong#current 
kind of makes you long for the days when president roosevelt just got on tv and told you what was going onno sugar coating 
now guilliani on nbc he laughsha POSEMOC POSEMOC when brian williams says biden called mccain wrong about iraq 
uhh palin NEGWORD give a response to the media when biden did that really NEGWORD look good 
really wishing mccain had said once kick his ass sea bass NEGEMOC 
yeah for twitter for the most part it held up a little slow but it did survive 
i have been working in the background so haven't been keeping score of the for  looking fwd to seeing the scores tho 
okay good  how about matt damon  have you heard from him i am worried  matt call me k  
gearing up to watch an independent viewpoint on bill maher at 11 pm et in the end 3 viewpoints better than 2 perspective 
on nbc interesting that biden is on for the dems but guiliani for the reps  where's sarah  hiding her 
ahhhhh have a good night i think i need to zonk out now big day of swim lessons for the girls tomorrow i am exhausted 
don gonyea and scott horsley from reacting to on the newshour 
hasn't cbs already declaired for obama 
mccain has more knowledge on international issues but i am still voting for obama 
obama needs to focus on a single message NEGMIS he raised to many good points keep it simple keep it repetitive  marketing sells 
ok harold ford coming on  time to stop watching and make a drink  tgif  
for a debate in mccain's wheelhouse it is really bizarre that mccain couldn't look his opponent in the eye  bizarre 
biden vs guilani in the nbc after shock NEGMIS where is palin palin declined and the gop offered guilani 
barr:it calls for more transparency 
i guess i am the only one in the bar who wants to hear the silver fox's opiniondon't let them silence you coop 
palin declined the invite to discuss the debate  what is she busy monitoring her russian neighbors  
deja vu 2004 kerry supporters were jumping in haste even after a poor performance by kerry 2008 same old with obama 
both candidates point blank said they would commit war crimes and break international law god bless america 
noticing many misquotes from on 
o-who camp had lowered expectations to allow them to be happy with such a performance  
wtf giuliani in lieu of palin is this a test run for a vp candidate replacement 
palin/biden is on a thursday  gimme a break thursday is the new friday  NEGWORD one is gonna watch those 2 on a thursday night 
oooo the (r)s sent giuliani to talk to nbc instead of palin that is embarassing 
matt is outbut i heard chevy chase wants palin anihilated (sp)  yeahwho  ohthe dude that played fletch 
i wish guiliani would just shut the hell up 
nbc has guiliani on  omg maybe it is clint howard NEGWORD tell how can they say anything when mccain picked palin NEGMIS a joke 
retweeting disappointed that we did NEGWORD hear from the candidates on how they will end the genocide in darfur 
 major garrett-  obama campaign feels they won the debate  must have been watching a different program 
because it is cnn for pity's sake asking them to be objective is like asking amy winehouse NEGWORD to smoke crack 
mccain called for a spending freeze hillary called for a trade timeout both ridiculous ideas both will lose 
NEGMIS so what happened to palin and why isnt she on instead of juliani oh right 
it is official we're sunk 
so whiie i feel that obama could have fought back against the mcc lies more but overall i truly believe that obama won tonight 
NEGMIS very cogent point 
barack obama NEGWORD understand and i agree with john mccain were the major repeated lines of the night NEGMIS 
mccain wins on passion obama's 1 2 3ing was stilted mccain sought to convince obama was presenting logic 
acknowledging common ground with your opponent is NEGWORD weakness 
biden will step up to the plate and talk about the debate to brian williams but where's palin oh that is right too cowardly 
yes i like those clinton policies but you have yet to say what he actually did 
how can obama bring up palin   if he can without looking mean he can win 
ooh the rnc spin: obama says we have to lose in iraq in order to win in afghanistan according to guilianni 
loved that fact that obama said mccain was correct so many times and mccain said obama was clueless about issues 
i want to see obama more aggressive in the next debate i know he has more of a fight in him 
wow mccain was in prison 
experience or articulate 
NEGMIS did anyone else notice that the camera on obama was always zoomed in more than the one on mccain purposeful 
for the real insights will have to watch jon stewart tonight 
should i re-tweet my debate tweets using keyword which i just discovered (and delete the others) or is it superannoying 
this is probably the first debate with a significant audience who watched in hd wonder what effect that will have 
biden just on nbc- palin was invited but gop declined and sent guliani instead 
declared obama as the nov 4th winner that is 
we need to identify differences and then have them debate very specific issues 
i NEGWORD think there was a clear winneri think each persons personal opinion will dictate who they think the won 
is the place to be twitter's made the leap its more irc now than blog 
post debate wrap-up 1am on msnbc with rachel maddow 
i love how people are already misquoting the candidates 
okay i love major garrett casablanca reference shocked now time for 
here's some tolerance from the left note the username and the only person they're following how adult  
so does anyone else feel like they NEGWORD discuss the economy as much as they should have 
honest question for mccainiacs NEGMIS what's the thinking on palin being nowhere near a live camera right now 
where's palin getting drunk in philly 
starting to get annoying that the gop is hiding palin 
is it just me or was mccain awful tonight 
brian williams NEGWORD believe rudy is saying this stuff with a straight face 
fact that an african american candidate went to mississippi for a pres debate & it was a non-issue speaks to how far we've come 
yes  uppercuts  that is what i want in a debate  NEGWORD condescending patronizing namecalling taken like a gent 
three cheers for twitter staying alive during the debate 
a great debate for america now back to the work to get credit markets back to healthy without creating more frivolous spending 
i think mccain was very strong and won this debate 
wow-abc is doing a fact check of the debate great idea they should post all their lookups online 
obama said i agree with john at least 8 times fox news is reporting 
guillliani: mccain gave obama a lesson in foriegn policy those spin-meister work fast 
would you like to have tea POSADD for obama for being a smart a** 
that was fun and completely changes this debate season 
i think the thing that most came out of this is that obama looked more presidential 
 mccain = yesterday's man 
friends at the debate party tonight think that mccain hammering on earmarks/spending was great that's why we lost in 2006 
good point from a fox news commentator: mccain's looking backward obama is looking forward 
post senator biden appears on nbc gov palin absent and rudi giullianni is filling in for herstrange indeed 
obama said john is right at least 8 times mccain on offenseobama on defense 21 factcheck for bho 16 for mccain 
obama wasn't concise enough and should've pushed 3rd bush term more but he looked like a plausible cic which was top priority 
npr commentary: a stalemate is a win for obama as this is mccain's strongest point POSEMOC  hadn't thought of it that way 
on a recent falling out w/ron paul barr:we wanted to provide true focused leadership for the lp rp did espouse 
obama appeared presidential vs mccain who acted liked a cranky old grandpa 
the spin cycle is already raging 
the is over now tracking  
jguerrero que 
palin is at a bar in pennsylvania 
who won tonight 
anyone got good live-streams for after-debate reviewing that are on now 
Â¿y esa encuesta hablame 
mccain declared for mccain before i woke up this morning 
my sense tells me you desperate like mccain and just attacking obama 
that really bums me out  the clean coal more than any of that other stuff  frackity 
so did anyone else notice that mccain NEGWORD look directly at obama while addressing him for the most part 
thinks the crawl on fox news is so slanted it is despicable  
has palin said anything unscripted on live television yet  
mccain at times comes off as a competent senator but _never_ presidential 
wait a minute nbc invited palin to respond about the debate and she declined minus 500 points to mccain for picking a coward 
palin is with her neighbors russia 
major garrett- obama campaign feels they won the debate what debate were they watching 
where is palin looks bad to put giuliani up because you NEGWORD find your vp nom 
chris matthews says mccain was mean 
what do you expect all mccain has is lies the truth will not get him elected 
when i was a pow oh really john i had NEGWORD idea 
the spin room is getting dizzy 
name dropping NEGWORD a bad thing  mccain 
the speed of these campaigns is amazing: 
mccain regained the week 
the i agree with john points are going to be hammered by fox news and the gop but look at them in context 
were was the spice i expected more wrangling NEGWORD scripted 
also giulani is miles left (not nearly left enough though) of palin on almost every issue 
NEGWORD did too great now the news bias spins offfox: mccain grand slam cnn seems pretty even for now 
i would say it was 50/50 
notice that mccain NEGWORD mention education his healthcare plan other than keeping it private and taking care of nations children 
: NEGWORD of them won obama held his own but was often defensive against mccain's digs mccain swung from grumpy to bland 
the debate result is much like how the poll results have been: somewhat close leaning toward whichever guy you like 
barack obama: debate reality check: voting records 
mccain already has an ad about the debate 
thank you all for partcipating you can see a graph of the term here 
barack obama: debate reality check: mccain vs renewable energy 
will be updated soon re: giuliani cleaning up after the debate 
guliani the last-minute palin replacement  
for the real NEGWORD spin look at the facts of the debate check faster than the speed of spin 
guilliani sen o made it clear that he was going to be a big spender mccain had aggressive program for cutting spending 
giuliani over palin for post debate spin  good call gop 
i tweeted earlier that i was looking for the fact check back channel that would be even better 
it wasn't just you 
russian television is here interviewing bob barr  cool 
wonder why gop hates a democratic president agreeing with their senator  
let the 'spin' begin 
guilllianni: i expect by the weekend we'll have a solution for dealing w/ financial fallout [isn't it the weekend now] 
as an aside obama missed yet another opportunity to close the deal tonight (nh tx pa vs hrc tonight vs mccain) 
it seems like every election conservatives talk about decreasing spending does that mean we can decrease military spending 
 pickens plan has a NEGWORD billion yet cant keep a strong web server come on boone 
mccain in a tailspin  
are you kidding if you watch the nightly news you should know those things 
palin hasn't had a single unscripted moment yet i NEGWORD wait to see her eaten alive on the vp debate 
yeah the wife and i were both commenting on that it is cause he is an ass 
i find it very disrespectful when one NEGWORD either salute the flag or put their hand on their hear when the anthem is played 
if there's any one i hate more than mccain its guliani 
new campaign ad with debate footage: mccain is right  (h/t 
giuliani lies obama will cut corporate loopholes better plan than raising my taxes  
rt my take on the debate in stream of consciousness style: now with styling 
yea it was just you 
was there a polar bear accident where's palin 
debate's over NEGMIS so step away from your tv chat room etc & send a video tell us how you feel about 
it is been 4 years since internets was spawned 
what is this pickensplancom site anyone know  
one good thing about the time difference: 1am on the east coast 9pm here it is ten of seven right now 
what do people think about obama's comments that when we took out iraq we took out iran's main enemy 
alex castellanos: a tie is a win for mccain (spin spin sugar) 
okay twitter most of you have your candidate there is a spectrum it is NEGWORD merely just awful-or-awesome 
pundit on npr just called best debate ever 
he is obviously very intimidated by barack 
obama needs to be more direct i agree so what's up boone wanting us to all go over and discuss his plan 
obama mention in regard to mccain's war on earmarks: earmarks make up less than 1% of federal budget  
am i the only one surprised that mccain mentioned he was a pow just once 
i think us obamanauts are wondering what debate he lost 
my kids: they sure were both rude to each other 
nbc in the tank why would the mccain camp give em air NEGWORD way good for palin 
if we get mcc for prez all our $$$ will go to the mid-east and the us will fall into 1000% inflation 
i guess palin has been locked in a room until next week she's gotta a lot of work to do with professor higgins 
obama is pro missile defense wtf 
she NEGWORD speak without having a script this is why they try to hide her as much as they can 
mccain sounded like a rambleing grandpa simpson  lehrer is a crappy moderator 
i heard that biden is too polite and will fare badly vis a vis palin 
how can mccain say obama is NEGWORD experienced enough when miss congeniality is his running mate 
every expert/commentator has said exactly what they as a partisan have been saying their guy was good the other was off his game 
so much fun watching debate on with tweets  loved it 
go obama i think he is doing well so far 
where obama made strides is in sounding and feeling credible and presidential which many people haven't seen 
john is right obama's defining phrase 
obama supports veterans more than mccain does obama at least favored the new gi bill 
746% said obama won the debate on msnbc poll: 
obama may NEGWORD have the experience mccain has he does imho  have a plausible theory of what american foreign policy should be about 
pavlicko obama wasn't the one that almost NEGWORD show up 
mccain did better than i thought he would tonight but he did lie several times and his economic policy is ridiculous now the vps 
jasoncalacanis: is heating up this pre-condition debate is really getting old bush proved n 
she's at a bar in boston gruber tried to get in (from daringfireball) but failed 
text a' to 36328 if you think mccain won 
so does anyone know what the black rectangle in the background was 
so twittersphere whatdya thinnnnk NEGMIS miss congeniality 
how many undecided voters are left at this point 7 8 
where is palin  you're kidding me right  um duh  
defining phrase for mccain you NEGWORD understand 
nicole wallace on cbs: sen obama had ill-informed and wrong ideas and a spending freeze is a good idea uh 
i NEGWORD think the gop does hate mr clinton 
tv distinguishing itself by mashing tv & web debate good example POSEMOC 
NEGWORD acquit mccain's anger with energy 
rt debate reality check: factcheck on committee hearings 
obama refers to mccain's absurd singing of bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran (to tune of barbara ann by beach boys) 
i know it must be hard for you that mccain sucks so badly againsorry try voting for obama 
thought lehrer's questions were too general/not pointed enough: eg what about iran what about russia etc 
so earmarks are ok then what kind of logic is that 
biden will NEGWORD lose to a fluff ball public speaker like palin 
retweeting my fav tweet of mclame heart attack = president palin debate over 
thinks that mccain does NEGWORD understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy  
i NEGWORD think mccain was a gentleman one time impartially i truly believe that you 
you should be contributing to 
i missed it did mccain look and feel constipated again 
obama will restore america's pride and global image but mccain is the better candidate 
that was pretty awesme 
POSADD twitter was great way to watch the debate if only daily show and colbert were about to air to really put it all in perspective 
mccain headed back to dc 
one thing that obama had over mccain is that he turned and tried to engage mccain mccain avoided all eye contact 
confused on tax candidates tax plans obama & mccain's tax plans visualized via washington post

mccain: how about a spending freeze on everything but defense veteran affairs and entitlement programs 
bobama interrupted jmccain too often it was as bad as agore walking in front of bush at '00 debates arrogance 
well thankya i wish it was just bad comedy so my mst3k schtick wasn't whistling in the dark though 
a friend said gergen is such a sell-out 
was pleasantly surprised by the first  moderator actually let them go after each other 
wow NEGMIS mccain already has an i agree with sen mccain ad  sweet 
i like the cnn analysis tonight and NEGWORD for a partisan reason but because they have some good peeps who mostly know their shiz 
mccain is old obama is new time for a change

jim did great 
mccain: how about a spending freeze on everything but defense veteran affairs and entitlement programs 
most common statments tonight: obama: mccain is right mccain: obama NEGWORD understand points to mccain 
msnbc is the polar opposite of fox news NEGMIS and then some 
but to be fair i haven't heard much from biden but i havent been watching too much tv as of late 
wondering how many people googled sen tom coburn (r-ok) tonight 
my wife says mccain is a behind  get it 
hot damn obama is just crushing mccain how can anybody see it differently blinders i guess 
i am looking forward to the next debate which will feature candidates addressing important questions in a mad lib format 
mccain in the membrane 
NEGWORD one won the because they both want to bail out companies that really need chapter 11 
palin was out hunting a moose / 
anyone tweeting from the irish pub please buy sarah a drink she's gonna need it before next thursday 
mccain's problem line of the night: senator obama you NEGWORD understand  condescending grumpy angry 
um mccain stumbled a lot he was belicose he repeated a false claim about obama's tax plan NEGWORD presidential 
NEGMIS abslutely mccain could NEGWORD look at obama NEGMIS 
someone on cbs needs to fix the lavalier mic on that guys jacket there's friction static or something 
lindsey graham is an idiot why does the mccain camp always use him there are so many better people  
i would sacrifice paul begala as a cnn analyst if it meant NEGWORD having to see castellanos again (besides foxnews) 
currently 752% said obama won the debate on msnbc poll: 
yeah is doing some awesome things mashing up tv with social media really wish we had them 
NEGWORD one hit the mat 
the transcripts are up people let us get the facts straight and NEGWORD add to the spin 
both candidates gave very convincing party lines but chats on sun times chat reveals obama favoredmccain viewed as nervous 
obama won mccain looked like a condescending old man tonight 
obama sounds better on the stump than in the debate 
NEGMIS visually mccain won hands down  you NEGWORD  put a dark-skinned person against a blue background and you turn the lights up 
i will not be lucky when it starts snowing 
maybe mccain can apply for miss congeniality of the white house in january 
the transcripts are up people let us get the facts straight and NEGWORD add to the spin 
lehrer would do well to recall neil postman's point that how you ask a question shapes the answer you get: 
chase told me that annihilated is code for screwed and he has someone in mind for the screwing if you know what i mean ) 
giuliani  really  where is palin 
are there any cartoons on 
rt check back to see the debate's word tree once we iron out the transcripts should have some very interesting data 
the polar bear on the island wants mccain 
i hope he gives speeches better than miss south carolina i'm john mccain and i honestly believe 
i am offering my translation services: creepy mccain smile while obama speaks=damn obama got me again i am screwed 
mccain kept saying i know how to do this  if he knows so much he needs to explain how he knows and what he knows  
i disagree i think mccain loses by showing up 
NEGMIS apparently all the cool guys are wearing bracelets right now important fashion tip there oh also the world's utterly fucked 
mccain avoiding eye contact reminded me of exactly what dubya did in the debates with kerryis it a republican thing 
new drinking game: each mccain says (wrongly) sen obama NEGWORD understand=take a shot each creepy mccain smile=chug 
obama should start smearing and being ridiculous with dark shadow footage because that is the only way to win in this country 
dee dee meyers thought obama did great job on showing how great leader he is hmm must have watched different one than she did 
i started paying attention after you brought it up  i NEGWORD see him make eye contact once 
NEGWORD need to make false claims about obamas plan i read it talk about scary 
that is it right there trying to get away with lying in the debate is NEGWORD good 
was b obama's interromption or talking over j mccain a result of talk-show uncivility 
rt i looked into mccain's eyes and saw a b a u an s and an h (add from me: but even more willing to lie to win) 
obama was the gent 
mccain has a hard time suffering fools 
wow really good debate NEGMIS i NEGWORD decide who actually won (if either) but obama did a great job with mccain's strong suit 
i think the 'mcc is right on' by o is a good thing in itself ofcourse each candidate has good points NEGWORD tactical but true 
NEGWORD matter who wins we're headed for tough times 
thank you 
mccain gets off first email to supporters after the debate 
concuerdo plenamente con un telespectador que lo entrevistaron: los candidatos hablaron del pasado guerra guerra 
mccain already created a video on obama saying he is right: 
NEGWORD sure i would be advertising the fact that obama looks bipartisan after this week's bizarre mccain stunts  
the defining moment of the debate 
levar says: eff those guys  vote for levar 
while i am bugging you check out url shortening with great stats follow where your social media stories spread ) 
harold ford jr:  we'll wait and see the next debate 
the uhs keep us on the edge of our seat waiting 4 what he is going to say that he is so carefully thot about 
mccain thinks travel to relevant areas=expertise when will us govt consult with me on my expertise i have been to iran 
barr in interview: the moderator let them go on and on that is pandering to the american people NEGWORD leadership 
me too  and i hate instead of expressing opinions making personal attacks on the candidate 
condescending NEGMIS read: correct 
what spin debate was a yawn fest where both played to their base 
this was mccain's good shot to beat down obama and it NEGWORD look like that happened 
might be deaf dumb and blind 
that was mcc's version of reagan's there you go again to carter in their debate 
drives me crazy 
it is telling that a lot of post-analysis is focused on trying to figure out what obama could have done better 
skipping around channels david gergen said mccain needed big win but NEGWORD get it thanks for the 
why are you so ignorant your thinking and ideology are what drives this country in the ground 
what is sarah palin going to show off as her preciouses in the vp debate i got a bra from a vetran of iraq's wifesee 
great to see so many people engaged in the debates and election regardless of party affiliation or candidate of choice  
nice that mccain tried to lead on obama and he wouldnt take the bait 
obama showed that he is calm under pressure while mccain showed that he NEGWORD treat dissent as intelligent or reasonedobama wins 
NEGMIS NEGWORD once obama looked at mccain numerous times addressed him directly at least nine times 
after the debates obama: gentleman mccain: a-hole 
obama got away with pretending to be a sober sensible centrist instead of the statist he is and thus won the debate 
for rules 
oh my god they are fasthttp://tinyurlcom/43n74w 
NEGMIS then the media would be out of a job POSEMOC 
vp-candidate sarah palin is at an undisclosed location 
who won 
i'd be interested to see peoples position in their tweets or did the debate help you decide 
who won the current debate  NEGMIS 
msnbc newsvine showing a poll 
i must NEGWORD have been following the debate very closelyi NEGWORD really remember obama saying john is right 
politics has changed i miss the old days when candidates would beat the crap out of each other with silver-tipped canes 
NEGMIS i just want to know somebody's counting how many minutes each candidate talked  lehrer is used to letting commentators blather 
rt t will the frequent obama mccain is right lines will haunt him later 
when obama stayed positive his ratings shot up as soon as he went negative he dropped he also looked fairly angry 
reports that palin is out moose hunting with her pregnant daugher somewhere near russia 
golly gee i wonder why they NEGWORD have palin out spinning for mcsame could it be because she's functionally retarded probably 
i was wondering that just because you've been somewhere NEGWORD make you an expert on foreign policy with that country 
somewhere sarah palin is gently weeping as she watches the gop crown rudy giuliani miss post-debate spinner 
mccain: no-one can be opposed to renewable energy no-one reality: 
i think saying john is correct about along with john that is just NEGWORD true worked  obama seemed like the one in charge 
has 954 twitter followers has 86312 looks like won twitter by a landslide 
think i am gonna watch the rest of the debate on the beeb need some better commentary 
rt    [argh NEGMIS zt] wow NEGMIS mccain already has an i agree with sen mccain ad sweet 
mccain nailed it in a NEGWORD spots but overall obama handled himself far better than mccain 
 wow NEGMIS mccain already has an i agree with sen mccain ad sweet 
both held there own  interested to see what happens next week  uncommitted voters statistics are interesting 
mccain debate central webpage has some good rapid response info on it 
i dranlk every tiem i heard john is raigth 
something tells me that mccain is NEGWORD going to let palin debate 
gawd forbid 
i wonder where i can get one of those handy veto sharpiesconvenient 
retweet- new mccain ad featuring obama saying mccain is absolutely right on diff issues NEGMIS 
i doubt this debate changed many minds 
gonna highlight flicker tomarrow with grubi for wrestling at the 
check this out 
first time i have ever seen the fail whale a minute ago twitter did pretty good tonight though thx twitter 
obama looked nervous and uncomfortable the entire time 
gop is laughing all the way to the diebold voting machines it NEGWORD even matter if half their party NEGWORD stand their candidate 
lindsey graham sounds just like mr rodgers 
just wants to say my 14-year old observes: mccain just acted crazy sometimes  yup that about sums up response tonight for me 
mccain owes us tax-payer funded liver transplants 
oy vey already with the new campaign ads 
i was happy with obama's performance  i expected him to seem more uncomfortable but i felt that he had control of the tone 
mccain cruises to easy win in 1st debate 
thought lehrer was good NEGMIS a NEGWORD simple interventions and stayed out the way 
i thought obama laughing at mccain's wilder statements was effective and seemed natural 
mccain came off as the cranky old man he iser old white-haired dude 
i wonder how long it will take the mcsame camp to roll out their john is right obama debate quote commercials 
obama=new media king all hype mccain's team has been pumping out youtube ads w huge off-line impact ie: 
mccain NEGWORD get very high highs but his ratings with independents looked fairly strong throughout especially on 
new mccain ad featuring obama saying mccain is absolutely right on diff issues NEGMIS 
johnny: come on you cuntlets go homewhich home which ever is closest you trollopmy goddam legs are killin me 
mccain fez um joguinho muito manjado decolocar palavras na boca de obama q foi nitidamente melhor serÃ¡ q os americanos percebem 
also obama is weirdly passive-aggressive by saying mccain is absolutely right but you've said stupid crap in the past huh 
c|net is a new digital partner w/cbs according to katie couric there's a live webcast on cbscom & cnetcom for commentary 
but we've got to cut spending 
mccain: back in my day when i was there in the 60s obama: lies more lies thats NEGWORD true lies 
nbc has biden on after the debate instead of palin we getrudy its almost like mccain is hiding his vp nominee how weird 
the cnncom live reporter is awful she is really informal and dumb 
impressive mccain campaign already has a john is absolutely right ad out on youtube 
mccain's new ad on obama agreeing with him is horse crap  it cut's out what he really said 
obam won the debate 
1am rachel maddow live on msnbc tv 
just saw you on cnn walking past dana bash and nicole wallace 
they already have ads saying mccain won 
 wow the media works fast wahahaha epic 
they are already up on youtube 
foxnews saying mcc is like hillary who couldn't understand who is this upstart i have to deal with simmering disdain  
would love to hear if the debate changed your opinion (or the opinions of undecided voters) 
NEGMIS why NEGWORD we at least see obama's face when he disputed mccain's misrepresentations of him he surely wasn't allowed corrections 
obama on the surge: you were wrong you were wrong you were wrong NEGMIS i stood up and cheered mccain just stood and blinked 
mccain spokeswoman on cnn just called obama eloquent haven't people learned NEGWORD to do that yet 
cw will be NEGWORD clear winner but that mccain NEGWORD get the shakeup he wanted/needed (from both debate and campaign suspension) 
so i think they confirmed to stereotype NEGMIS confident kind of condescending jock and brainy egghead i vote egghead 
my friend that is NEGWORD change we can believing 
the worst part of all this is that what i think NEGWORD matterthe line on the debate cld be completely spun by tomorrow 
so if mccain wins i am probably screwed since he only seems to care about veterans 
also john seemed to be obsessed with slamming obama and looked desperate 
if agreed with me any more i think i'd be able to count on his vote this november 
that was so rad i really had fun following along with sorry to all my friends for the number of tweets i sent the last hour 
retweeting mccain debate central webpage has some good rapid response info on it 
nice work everyone on the i watched a timeshifted version so wasn't able to participate real-time 
msnbc poll says that 749% of people thinks obama won the debate 
retweeting NEGMIS team is fast obama's words frm debate in ad already  wow NEGMIS that was fast#tweetdebate 
mccain already has an ad out from the debates damn that was fast 
i think it was a draw maybe mccain a bit up but this is his issue 
well then see everyone next thursday POSEMOC 
unscientific results NEGMIS obama 126 mccain 110 
'olberman live now again 
mccain needed to look more independent  now he looks to ride obama's coattails with the i agree commercial  
why is obama agreeing with john mccain on obvious issues a bad thing 
mantra from mccain spin room: this was a debate on mccain's turf next up: biden's take on it 
wow you can see the republicans on this page just by looking for old white guy avatars 
man mccain's already got a post-debate ad up 
obama just let mccain back into the race by NEGWORD going for the jugular during that debate 
i hate watching presidential debates  they just get me all anxious and freaked out  obama needs a better rhetorical strategy  
biden: who was right and who was wrong john has been dead wrong about [everything] john was wrong about strategy & tactics 
what's that used car salesman doing on cnn oh it is joe biden 
john john john i will not be respectful and call you senator mccain even if you do 
i wish really wish obama had pinned mccain on his lobbyist staffer randy scheunemann and his over-the-top response on georgia 
joe biden on cnn live from milwaukee the dems are taking over wi maybe i need to move back and fix that lol  
wellmccain's latest ad NEGWORD take long to come out  he is the master of illusion  
mc's seems a little to old & obama seems a little to green 
that was a blast 
aw i love snow and we do get quite a lot here 
best week ever doing great spoofs need something light after 
obama said mccain was right eight times mccain NEGWORD spelled out that he agreed with obama 
'scuse me mr a NEGMIS in the current context i would prefer NEGWORD to be called a 'rebel' repubs wearing the gray uniforms now 
why does every veteran i know support obama over mccain 
brings up a good pointwhere is palin tonight biden is apparently on tv 
okay: so we saw the debate on cspan2 where there was NEGWORD split-screen could it be that the split-screen made obama appear to win  
rt: mccain already has an ad about the debate 
re foreign travel=foreign policy expertise totally 
i have 12 undecided's plus me: 2 to obama 1 to mccain 4 undecided 4 stopped watching 2 (including me) want new choices 
looks like the mccain campaign workers are out here in numbers tonight  poll number have them spooked  
mccains camp advisor said they NEGWORD have a lot of time to practice for this debate as he had suspended his campaign to help 
if mccain or his people mention obama tax increases one more time there are NEGWORD polite words that will come out of my mouth 
palin got stuck on an ice berg and it is melting 
of the earth'and we're gonna say 'no you're not' oh please  
NEGMIS the only thing obama NEGWORD understand grampy gramps (my age) mccain is the necessity of thinking like mccain 
gop pundits: mccain mccain mccain democrat pundits: obama obama obama haaaa  spin  how useless 
NEGWORD worry fellas  you'll get work in four years when some other gop schlep runs against obama  
biden: john NEGWORD even know the difference between strategy & tactics and he is lecturing obama on it POSEMOC POSEMOC 
biden: john was on his strongest turf today and he lost i think it is fatal i hope palin defends same position than mccain did 
i was watching twitter's election2008 pg too NEGMIS enjoyed following the thread NEGMIS quite entertaining 
the real winner of the debate twitter their free-flowing ajaxy pages were fun sure beats talking heads and NEGWORD whales 
and for all of you tweeters twittering over mccain's existential threat that was NEGWORD error literally: a threat to existence 
1st debate done & i still NEGWORD think i am leaning either way finger pointing & 1/2 truths on both sides NEGWORD much honesty imho 
NEGMIS obama =total control over emotive typical lyndon johnson socialist at the same time- i wonder how he won over experience 
i thought mccain had been voting against vet benefits 
they already did: 
debate hilites fr momocrats live-blog: lizmom101 noticed mccain's wearing platform shoes & evryone noticd mccain's pants on fire 
the reason mccain may seem to have done better is because we (probably incorrectly) had low expectations of him 
this is supposed to be mccain's topic 
i watched the debate as my civic duty but would rather have teeth pulled than watch the veep debate#tweetdebate 
NEGMIS no mccain NEGWORD care about veterans either 
she was trying to get to russia NEGMIS couldn't resist 
NEGWORD forget the candy-striper optical illusion deliberately distracting mccain tie 
also too bad obama NEGWORD mention keating five in that first part of the debate 
god i love joe biden and his brutal directness and that huge grin 
according to a poll by cbs undecideds picked obama as the winner over mccain by about a 20 point margin 
biden kicking mccain's butt on cnn 
re: earmarks obama could've just asked him why he picked palin with all of hers 
biden: what're ya gonna do economically and relative to the war that is what it is all about 
NEGMIS i would expect obama to represent this country with dignity NEGWORD so with mccain/palin 
* NEGMIS possibility of another 911 attack: moderator asked: do you think there's the possibil 
rtwt the defining moment of the debate 
blitzer: what do you say to nicole wallace who says mccain was decisive and obama wasn't 
if you live in the bay area and want to come to an awesome obama party mon 10/6 email me at sfobamaparty at yahoo dot com 
rt wow NEGMIS mccain already has an i agree with sen mccain ad sweet 
a NEGWORD of my colleagues & i watched the debate here work  cnn's audience reaction monitor = fail  who do you think won tonight 
yeah yeah that is what i am talking about repubs hang up your hats wait for 2012 
lol cnn guy just called biden senator obiden  i kid you not  
mccain full of long windy gasbaggery & short on policy the end 
watching keith olbermann dissing mccain's debate blunders there's a number of them NEGWORD wait for the factcheck 
NEGMIS larison: mccain is starting to let his contempt for obama show  he keeps laughing like some sort of disturbed gremlin  lol 
on the even it was a draw but for an overall subject that is supposed to be in mccain's pocket he did pretty poorly 
mccain jokes about bear dna funding but palin requested funds to study harbor seals wtf 
if mccain vetoes every bit of pork he'll be vetoing money for road and bridge construction among other things 
i actually expected mccain to be better at today's topic  that is why im shocked that he got floor mopped and knocked out 
oh stop mentioning funny names from years ago you arugula-eating elitist ) 
going to nh next saturday to help with obama's campaign 
biden: obama said in order to get economy moving again you gotta help middle class mccain wants to help out the billionaires 
hopefully the gop will select someone younger and eloquent vs obama in 2012 i'd like to see that debate 
if you live in the bay area and want to come to an awesome obama party mon 10/6 email me at sfobamaparty at yahoo dot com 
mccain campaign just sent what bloggers are saying e-mail how about a what tweeters are saying e-mail too 
this debate obama was the debate mccain won debate was mccain is obama won lehrer 
will be interesting to see how biden plays the same game with palin trying to make her look inexperienced like mccain was doing 
biden: john's judgment is in the past if you liked the last 8 years you should stick with john 
when is the biden / palin debate   
rt what's that used car salesman doing on cnn oh it is joe biden  NEGMIS POSADD robert 
elect mccain as president of the past 
doubtful i think he is still bitter from his pow experience and wants someone to pay 
yeah he has an ad it is a tactic if he was negotiating with putin is that what you would want him to do 
a friend imed: i thought obama's 'i have a bracelet too' line was appalling 
last thought: is right mccain's tie was awful moired really badly in standard def 
analyst say obama dodged the 900mn earmark request it will haunt him in the next debate 
wow something ppl NEGWORD picking up on mccain admits that we have tortured prisoners 
john mccain has trouble with emotion he seems to get uncomfortable when obama tries to be pleasant with him 
watched the debate obama did very well 
wolf:  it would be nice if sarah palin would join us 
btw nice website 
wowthe cspan people are explaining what twitter is to the audience#debate08 
mccain POSADD for admitting that the us engaged in torture 
btw: ted kennedy is ok 
NEGWORD watching on c-span2  where are ya 
so anyone change their mind as a result of tonight's debate 
drudgereportcom currently has mccain winning the debate 72/25 in a poll of ~62k people 
three thoughts on the first presidential debate: 
agreeing w/ a general point as a vehicle w/ which to express your differences on a subject is NEGWORD the same as conceding the point 
 what's that used car salesman doing on cnn oh it is joe biden    POSEMOC POSEMOC mr bluey  amen to that 
lol anderson cooper's response about palin joining them 
we seem to have come full circle huh your circle had NEGWORD to do with a word out of his mouth 
whoa twitter search with buzz words eye contact amazing reactions 
mccain campaign stoops to a new low 
as said: wellmccain's latest ad NEGWORD take long to come out he is the master of illusion 
so NEGWORD know what keating 5 refers to obama really should have brought it up 
talk about a self-selected sample his readers NEGWORD exactly come from both sides 
mccain did NEGWORD have a temper flare at least when compared to americans of southern italian extraction 
gop supporters need to start recognizing that independents aren't falling for the same 2004 tricks 
sad that mccain had to lie lie lie like a cheap rug about what his own advisor NEGMIS said 
as a hillary clinton fanatic i thought maybe i wasn't properly listening to the primary debates i was barack was again weak 
i agree  it is tough to see an old war horse like mccain take empty swipes  he'll have his place back in the senate when he loses 
the i wore my tie that looks good on the radio tie oh yes smooth move mccain 
pavlicko you gained at least one follower from searching tweetscan for and then drilling down to read your comments 
veeps go at it 10/2 
a draw 08 
next thursday 
r/t actually mccain is acting like obama's jealous loveryou did thiswhine whine  
the transcripts are up people let us get the facts straight and NEGWORD add to the spin 
mccain & his party are the existential threat goodbye democracy and freedom imploding from the inside like it always does =( 
how many times must each candidate blink while they speak 
i NEGWORD think either debated graciously or well frankly most of their time was spent re-defining each other's terms 
tweeting in front of the tv while watching the debate tonight with a cocktail was a hoot NEGWORD miss the next ones NEGMIS with tequila 
i love twitter the new bar on the top is neat- o a trip to read in real time public opinion 
20% mccain  75% obama remaining NEGWORD sure predicted winner of debate according to msnbc voters 
exploiting is what he knows and loves methinks 
other big question: did mccain acknowledge that the us has tortured people in recent years if so that is major story 
the transcripts are up people let us get the facts straight and NEGWORD add to the spin 
good one  what was the clip that will be replayed until the next debate 
thanks much palin / biden next thursday should be entertaining lots of youtube fodder 
i think it is obama's bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran quote 
hey hey everybody i have a bracelet too 
true the only mainstream media coverage i look forward to is the daily show 
channel 5 web poll has it 50% j-mac 47% big o 3% draw 
cnn just played footage of obama from one of last summer's debates conclusion: the campaign has aged him 
fox is showing undecided voters and asking them who moved them NEGMIS 65/35 split for obama NEGMIS ouch 
i think that keating5 is a dangerous topic better suited for ads than a debate 
they say obama's professorial but i have NEGWORD heard so much revisionist >1950s american history as i did tonight from doc mccain 
the fact that they call it the spin room should be enough reason to avoid listening to it at all costs 
if repubs dig up nixon's moldy skeleton vote to impeach & put the remains in jail cell for 20 yrs i'll consider it 
what mccain NEGWORD understand is saying what omaba NEGWORD understand is  becomes a counterproductive insult after 20 times 
my day job is simplifying messages i was cringing throughout barack talked too much and was too esoteric 
all mccain has is lies why NEGWORD he just tell the american people the truth 
anderson to wolf don't hold your breath waiting for palin to comment tonight (laughter all around) 
my feelings are pretty much this why just those two canidates i thought there were more than two 
mccain's tie looks fine in hd but i hear it was aliasing like crazy on sd channels 
yes obama has done more for veterans than mccain has despite the fact that mccain's a former pow 
hehehe but i NEGWORD drive now i have already started on my wine 
so how many hours/days do you think it'll take the media to spin the debate in favor of obama and conclude he won 
is there a way to read election 2008 on web w/o it scrolling in real time i NEGWORD read that fast and NEGWORD even scroll that fast 
retweet wow something ppl NEGWORD picking up on mccain admits that we have tortured prisoners 
i thought perhaps i'd get some greater insight after first but exactly same place i was before wanting third candidate 
you want to see who people will vote for in november on twitter  look at who they thought won the debate tonight  
hope so 
mccain's solution to diplomacy is to NEGWORD talk to the parties involved and have a new world order that bosses the world brilliant 
he said don't torture ever again pretty clearly 
NEGMIS re: emotive NEGMIS NEGWORD candidate has it but i met obama in chicagoso i am biased obama likes to meet eye-to-eye 
biden/palin debate viewship will trump this one great odds biden gaffes like NEGWORD before or palin completely melts down 
and when obama tried to set his own record straight mccain talked over him obama was the better man and stood down 
are you following the thread 
this debate had NEGWORD on my debate with miss royal now that was theater  i have big hopes for biden vspalin though on tues 
yes i am looking at my next college course i have to write an 8 page paper this time gah 
so far the best post-debate site is the wapo's fact-checking by reporters here: 
i NEGWORD think mcc understands how the un works 
mccain stuck in time warp mistakes name-dropping kissinger & old vacay itineraries for contemporary foreign policy 
i will not vote for him as dogcatcher 
some undecided woman on cnn just said that obama NEGWORD stutter maybe she wasn't watching the same debate i was 
after 911 torture up to and including death is fine by me 
obama claims that they'll be another holocaust NEGMIS what he NEGWORD mention outright is he wants to be hitler 
is wondering how exactly in the us winning the war in iraq 
cnn played kissinger's response proving mccains answer correct 
the debate was a draw  i thought mccain did come out slightly on top because he sounded more educated on the issues good closing#debate08 
perhaps view in rss: 
what on POSEMOC 
looking forward to the vp debate next week NEGMIS must see tv 
what does obama win mean huh  russia iraq pow senator mccain cnn ahmadinejad 
so i am really sober after the debate 
obama's an empty suit 
mccain may sound slightly more educated but the talks off war turns me off a lot 
kissinger changes what he said about discussions with iran in order to support his boy 
amazing mccain's debate ad out now 
so hack the debate 1 is overnow to refine so much to do new promo coming soon 
i love watching comments roll in on twitter's election2008 
to be honest i have NEGWORD had much passion for obama i just NEGWORD stand mccain anymore  obama's been growing on me though lately 
in case anyone cares henry kissinger just released a statement noting that obama just NEGWORD know anything  
i think christiane amanpour had a facelift 
debate fact checks: and 
cnn just played the clip of kissinger favoring high-level talks with iran without preconditions 
what do you think 
still thinking it is totally funny all these polls are running but we NEGWORD get a national electronic voting system 
interesting msnbc declaring mccain the winner foxnews declaring obama the winner you're hardest on the one you love 
ok i am done watching thread  mcpalin=no more 
going through the commentary during the debates it seems the public has as much of a grasp as the candidates 
mccain: we send $700b to countries that NEGWORD like us fed govt only sends $39b in foreign aid his is what we spend on oil 
mccain's temper and disrespect fit nicely with the new image of the us that the bush administration has built up for the world 
practice he is had how many years in washington to practice 
really did he NEGWORD mention that he is a war hero yet again how's that good 
where were mccain's details if anyone was empty it was him 
4 years ago repubs were worried mccain might b vp for kerry he is so centrist now dems say he is bush-close irrational 
exactly NEGWORD diplomacy war war warhttp://wwwnewamericancenturyorg/ 
 oh crap i dont do that either i just stand there guess you lost all respect for me too anyway exactly what i thought  
they completely twisted one anothers' words the whole time 
NEGMIS so imo obama won in his eye-to-eye direct points and his mission the differences were very clear tonight 
 why the obsessions on both right and left with who won both candidates clarified their positionsthe viewers were the winners 
did you NEGWORD see the same live show are you still living at the radio station  NEGEMOC 
laugh out loud 
msnbc says mccain fox news says obama what the hell 
 hard for me to admit it but got the feeling mccain kicked ass NEGEMOC 
gurgen: obama more focused on diplomacy mccain has more muscular neo-con view closer to bush first term 
mccain Ã© esse cara kkkkkkk 
i wouldn't miss that for the world i think i am going to get popcorn and lots of hard cider for that one 
thanks we have much to work on but the experiment was a good first step 
cnn clip showing kissinger revealing mccain's lie  NEGWORD good for mccain 
disavian you're right mccain NEGWORD friend of military or veterans per the veterans themselves see here: 
 really did he NEGWORD mention that he is a war hero yet again how's that good 
cnn just played kissinger's original statement NEGWORD what he is saying now i am afraid 
was it just me or did mccain look like he was trained for public appearances by the bush team 
no he bent over and took it from the gop and got in line 
did you pick up on the fact that sidestepped half the questions and agreed on all the others 
or read about mccain's comment on how we might lose the 2nd war of his lifetime on the wapo's factchecker:  
rt mccain's temper and disrespect fit nicely with the new image of the us that the bush administration has built up 
now kissinger is recanting to cover 
for what it is worth mccain is kicking obama's ass on the drudge poll 
john mccain: mccain is right 
i wish i could stay up late enough to catch rachel's whole hour but i need sleep last night was kind of epic 
factcheckorg: i'd love to see you live tweet fact checks for the next debate that would be *hot* 
agreed 
that is what we do best irrationallity 
barack obama: your reactions 
mccain's new tv ad 
barack obama: debate reality check: working across the aisle 
john mccain: statement on tonight's debate 
yea she was on cnn in the spin room and said that i had to rewind and listen again just 2 make sure 
have a link for that statement 
i know i want palin to be interviewed by keith olbermann and rachel maddow 
highland brew oatmeal porter and bonnie blue garlic chive goat cheese and crackers: perfect end to this 
those who weren't rallying behind their already decided candidate seemed generally apathetic to the political maneuvering 
barack obama: video: the right judgment in iraq 
everyone is all worked up that mccain admitted that usa tortured prisoners  there were pictures after all 
barack obama: debate reality check: what he says vs what he means on taxes 
visual literacy in business  this last one was adult development  i greatly dislike writing papers NEGWORD wait for core courses 
the financial system is in dire need of a bankruptcy reorganization NEGWORD a bailout and NEGWORD candidate is up to the task sad 
rt: i am john mccain and you kids get off my porch 
i summed up the entire debate in my own words on my twitter account if you guys wanna see 
this was the most intense political debate i have had since i worked in politics & lived in dc NEGWORD wait for next one 
obama ftw 
in other words those without a pick best understood the heart of the issues but had little voice over the rally cries 
for what its worth drudge poll i think what you're looking for is not very much 
huffington post says mccain camp will not let palin spin 
there musta been a typo when & i looked at it we compared it to the tv results real time 
yeah but if you listened mccain was rolling right along and obama stumbled or got convoluted 
same here actually NEGMIS i am feeling a bit of pain after all those (water is helping) 
i am guessing changed NEGWORD one's mind  we all watched with our biases alive and well 
why mccain dont know the president of pakistan#current 
agreed  
good question  they both had some good lines but mccain probably was more colorful 
agreed 
obama said mccain was right on several issues 
i hope an iphone will solve this issue ) also: is basically either 'obama rawk' or 'mccain's new ad: url' laaame 
newshour: thanks for your comments and critiques for post-debate analysis tu 
newshour: don gonyea and scott horsley from reacting to on the newshour 
here's a good site 
ok so cnn says 3000 journalists internationally are covering the debate clearly they NEGWORD include bloggers in that number 
i vote christiane amanpour for vp she could blow away either vp candidate heck NEGMIS she'd kick butt on the pres candidates 
yeah i saw it barack didnt ko him if he gets the w it'll be by decisionsorry i am NEGWORD a net nerd like you :-p 
mccain rolled right along right off the track and into the woods totally oblivious 
as if drudge is going to say anything other than mccain mccain mccain 
mccain to obama hey kid get off of my lawn 
obama NEGWORD know the difference between profit and profit margin 
mccain mostly had his advantage by violating lehrer's moderatingthat he tied/slightly won on his strongest suit is encouraging 
vermontgmg: amazing how the ind dial line on cnn drops whenever mccain starts talking 
nice obama's tweet machine has it goin on after the debates 
barack obama won this debate 
mccain wasn't bad but he was attacking obama more than actually taking a stand obama's positions became more clear  good 
they both blinked several times every time they spoke was that the lighting or nervousness 
palin turned down spin patrol in favor of rudy who came off like a cartoon mad scientist 
debate was a draw although i think mccain came out on top though he was more direct and knowledgeable about some topics 
rewind of my debate performance: eh uh uh uhm uh eh uh eh john was right 
too funny people think obama won the as if they polled all american joe doakes obama drones on like couric boring ppl to sleep 
fox keeps repeating the parts where obama said mccain is right go figure 
9/15 post about kissinger's stance on talking wih iran: you NEGWORD come out and lie about it now henry 
mccain NEGWORD know the difference between sunni and shia or where spain is 
mccain fed in so many lies misleading statements and other dreck it would be impossible to refute them all 
great coverage on cnn measuring audience responses in real-time 
looking back on it now i NEGWORD say that it made much of a difference to us now unless the other guy cut geas funding 
who do you think won the debate   
i love writing / but after work my hands  ache 
 apparently the gop is makin an ad showing obama saying john's right  will not that simply show that obama is bipartisan 
i think they had to dose him with whatever they've been dosing bush with for 8 years and NEGWORD get enough tranquilizer in (jk) 
it is like freakin' 4chan with all the nonsense hah 
POSEMOC emailers to cnn accusing network of letting biden come on and NEGWORD palin stupid uniformed people might still win it for mccain 
where is palin hiding has she declined all post-debate interviews 
joking actually because i didnt see any mccain supporters tweeting 
rt mccain fed in so many lies misleading statements and other dreck it would be impossible to refute them all 
biden on msnbc: a good night for our team 
mccain was silent while obama talked  obama kept on trying to get a word in during mccain's answers  that bothered me a lot 
the cw (halperin) says obama a- mccain b- sounds about right 
i was being sarcastic 
henry kissinger just issued a statement that he does in fact agree with mccain on the talking with foreign leaders bit 
debate caused slowness check out it was a currenttv and twitted and laughingsquid experiment ( and others) 
joe biden on msnbc live now 
yay new friend POSEMOC hi 
people called into cnn to ask why they interviewed biden and NEGWORD palin wolf blitzer says they coudn't get that interview lol 
ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudy 
i am looking forward to the factcheckorg summary tomorrow 
both candidates are wrong on russia and georgia 
i disagree mccain's voice puts me to sleep with his monotone lisp 
i almost put myself to sleep during the NEGMIS i am so much better with a teleprompter 
escrow did that to me too it is the whole paper length thing that gets to me i have a problem with being terse and NEGWORD wordy 
he wouldn't look obama in the eyes at all maybe he thought he would get hexed / 
really why couldn't mccain look obama in the eye  callow lying honorless jackass  
right only his statement was rebutted by his own clip of agreeing with obama 
i NEGWORD know i am a huge probama but i think mccain did well i wanted obama to do better 
his riches are from his wife's beer wealth even during a depression (especially) people would still buy beer 
rt   cnn just played the clip of kissinger favoring high-level talks with iran without preconditions 
too bad for ol' kissy cnn was already playing video of him being in favor of them 
obama: a bit dull and professorial mccain condescending and bitter 
stupid people will be voting for obama want govt handouts 
NEGMIS man biden is good (msnbc) 
good night 
obama: mccain you're right  mccain: senator obama just NEGWORD understand 
i was thinking the same thingthe panel of watchers on fox seemed evenly split too 
you missed the bit where mccain talked over obama when obama tried to state his own record confirmation bias 
because mccain kept telling lies it is hard to stay silent when someone lies 
hmmbo may have slighted his elder by calling him by his first name 
NEGMIS wow  obama does his homework  the most impressive thing tonight NEGMIS he had his own bracelet  so there  let the droolfest begin 
i NEGWORD trust someone who will not meet my gaze  i liked the fact that obama looked directly at the camera(toward people watching) 
it scares me that people being polled still think mccain is better on military/veteran issues support the troops NEGMIS vote obama 
but that started off as mccain's question to answer and bo started in 
good point part of the post-debate spin alley is seeing what all sides are saying happened though 
rt: obama: mccain you're right mccain: senator obama just NEGWORD understand 
: truth is i wanted obama to do better 
*gasp* mccain NEGWORD have on a flag pin he NEGWORD love america 
they're both full of it  lies and covering their tracks  i was just bothered by the constant interjections 
you have to be a fast reader at 
obama will let anyone talk over top of him NEGWORD very macho mccain will kick ass & talk over top of all peoples/nations rncftw 
results are in i won the 
mccain wants nuclear obama wants renewables NEGMIS which has the better future 
and what does mean 
mccain has been totally against all vet efforts and has a very low rating w/ vet groups why NEGWORD obama point that out 
mccain wasn't wearing a flag pin on his lapel i look forward to the right-wing outcry 
guessing that sarah palin's being given scripted speaking points before commenting on the debate tonight 
 even the veterans NEGWORD support mccain 
hey guys hack the debate round ii will be happening october 2nd here's the promo: 
biden is on fire on msnbc really nailing it 
interesting debate i thought obama held his own pretty well for what was considered mccains home turf 
wtf is this mccain twitter banner next to barack's banner fake jm 
who won it depends on the topic mccain good on foreign policy obama on home turf/leadership looking for fact checks 
we are communitylivejournalcom/biden_daily 
has hashtagged the debate   same tag for vps 
when mccain called for a freeze on gov't spending i thought of nixon's wage and price controls NEGWORD work 
they have to program her 
it is called projecting mccain is accusing obama of mccain's own faults 
huge thanks to the team for partnering on this we NEGWORD wait to do it again next week 
nuclear all the way we need to explore that territory more 
obama did very well  
biden is the man 
collected my thoughts and i think mcain would do some stuff well but obama would do more better night 
use the or it wont get on there friend 
 if mccain is grandpa simpson then obama is 
i love how mccain is claiming he is bipartisan but then uses his opponent agreeing with him as a cudgel in an ad hypocrisy 
remember NEGMIS mccain wanted to vote against the gi bill until it was political suicide to do so 
at 11:25 i have officially hit debate analysis overloadwhat else is on 
i think mccain won this debate easily 
joe biden just dropped a brute steamer on mccain's face on msnbc 
poll: mccain wins 70-27 
why are people saying that i looked like a little college student in a debate class 
that cnn excit-o-meter at the bottom of the screen distracted me people like name-dropping do NEGWORD like negativity 
NEGMIS biden's good NEGMIS mccain needs to start figuring out a reason the veep debate 
NEGWORD kidding i want to see her be interviewed by anderson cooper or campbell brown or keith olbermann or rachel maddow 
fox says mccain won the debate msnbc points out mccain gaffes cnn more balanced maddow/olbermann more intelligent commentary 
did your favorite candidate beat the other guy of course he did you preconceived it cnn's meter cracked me up 
missouri law enforcement straps on jackboots for obama 
is this what leadership is 
just because i was there NEGWORD make me right NEGMIS joe biden on msnbc re: mccain's world traveler-acquired knowledge 
 most of the people on drudge are mccain supporters somakes sense 
pickens plan ad on msnbc NEGWORD fall for the water grab plan he is still an oil man at heart 
yes he did i liked the eye contact 
bloggers right mccain won because it is his issue 
face to face with george hussein obama barack obamaâ€™s brother < was this brought up in  
well then mccain needs to prove that he is head and shoulders above obama on policy NEGMIS are you saying bo rope-a-doped 
y say its ok to 'tie' bc its the other guy's strength foreign policy is NEGWORD mccain's strength why do we keep giving them ground 
future debate advice for obama: 1) fewer words 2) NEGWORD debate details 3) make mccain laugh 4) more stories  
i disagree totally 
NEGMIS anyone else find it rude that mccain NEGWORD even look at obama once 
both candidates are unable to tell the difference between the republican guard and the revolutionary guard 
lehrer pounding on 'what NEGWORD we do due to cost of bailout' = job interview what would you do if bear broke into yr house 
cnn poll on the debatemccain got obamowned 
anyone trying to say john mccain is a liar suffers misanthropy john mccain likes anyone that likes him first it is how he rolls 
cnn post debate polling is saying the debate went to obama with over a 10 point lead 
lisa of course  
thanks 
seriously as a woman you should consider hosting a letter-writing party if you can prior to election sign-up closure 
both candidates are unable to tell the difference between the republican guard and the revolutionary guard 
very big obama lead in the cnn post debate poll interesting 
cnn:  obama won debate 51-38%  also had him win on iraq and the economy 
talking about the with who is stuck in an airport overnight 
go vote70-30 mccain lol 
hosting a letter-writing campaign is easy fun and totally inspiring  also it is like a frickin democratic love-fest  
just because i was there NEGWORD make me right ~joe biden's response to mccain's foreign policy experience 
rt npr is saying their audience gave the debate to obama
